<div id="intro" style="display: block;"><h1>Mechanic Training</h1><p><b>This is not a test.</b></p><p>This is simply a teaching tool. It is not expected that you know the answer of everything that is asked here. The purpose of this is to create a discussion around the topics that we encounter as mechanics by asking relevant questions that can often come up during the job, and providing the answer as well as a possible explanation as to why. Even if you don't remember every answer, you will eventually through repetition as you work and you repeatedly encounter these topics. If you don't know the answer to a question, then you can ask and I will straight up give you the answer with no judgment, then we can discuss that question until you feel comfortable with the topic.</p><p>It is encouraged to ask any questions you have along the way. That benefits you by making sure you understand the topics, but also it's difficult to teach things when I don't even know what you don't know in the first place, so it benefits the teacher as well.</div>

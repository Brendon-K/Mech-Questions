AC is what we provide through wall/drop cable outlets, and DC is what we would generally find inside our game cabinets and other electronics. This is because AC is cheaper to transport over long distances, so that is what gets provided to our building, but we need DC to run the components in our games and other devices due to its nature of only flowing in one direction.

This allows it to be used on more heavy duty fasteners as the hammering force can allow the driver to maintain a solid grip with the head of a screw. However, this extra force can come with a cost. Using an impact driver on lighter duty fasteners can cause damage. For example, you should always avoid using impact drivers on plexi because you can risk cracking the plexi from the additional force.<br>While impact drivers may look smaller, and appear to be the weaker of the two options, the impact driver can afford to be so small because it's a more specialized tool. You can see in the comparison pictures that the non-impact drill driver has many settings it can choose between, which requires a larger build.<img class=\"answer_img\" src=\"img/driver compare.jpg\" alt=\"photo of impact driver and cordless drill driver next to each other for comparison\"><img class=\"answer_img\" src=\"img/driver settings.jpg\" alt=\"photo of the top of impact driver and cordless drill showing that the drill is larger because it has additional settings'\">"

                "answer": "No. That is way too many tickets and no game should be awarding that many all at once.
